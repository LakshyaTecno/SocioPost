I am a social media application that allows users to share posts with images, captions, and tags. Guests can view posts but cannot like or comment, while logged-in users can interact with the posts by liking and commenting.

DB Relationship:

The database for this social media application would have several tables to store different types of data. The main tables would include:

Users: This table would store information about the users of the application such as their name, email, password, and profile information.
Posts: This table would store information about the posts such as the image, caption, and tags.
Comments: This table would store information about the comments on posts, including the user who left the comment and the text of the comment.
Likes: This table would store information about the likes on posts, including the user who liked the post.
Notifications: This table would store information about the notifications sent to users, including the type of notification and the user who received it.
Real-time features:

New post: When a new post is created, it is immediately sent to all subscribed users in real-time.
Like increment: The analysis for the post being most liked is done in real-time, and the like count is updated accordingly.
Notification: When a user likes or comments on a post, a notification is sent to the user in real-time.
Active user tracking:

Top 5 active users: The application tracks the active users and displays the top 5 most active users.
Active time: The application tracks the active time of the user weekly, daily and monthly and displays it.
Overall, I am a dynamic, real-time social media application that provides an engaging and interactive experience for use
